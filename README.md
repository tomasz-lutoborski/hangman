# hangman

It's implementation of classic hangman game in React. My version allows user to choose language of word to guess (polish or english), words lenght and number of chances before losing. In building this app I have used useContext hook to manage user setting and React Router v6 to manage going from settings page to game. Although simple, it taught me basics of managing state, navigating between pages and storing global state using context instead of prop drilling.
